# Natural Language Processing

In this repo I will be uploading all my progress learning NLP by my own.
I will follow the content of the Coursera course "Natural Language Processing Specialization", and apply it to my own projects.

The project will be separated into courses, which will contain the course content and examples, and a personal project applying the course content.

## Course 1: Classification and Vector Spaces in NLP

### Week 1: Logistic Regression for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
